  Smash Bros Factory  
</h1>

### 🤔 What's this??

This project tries to incorporate the abstract factory design pattern with smash bros characters.

It's worth say that this has been created by a first-year computer science student in their free time so, I'm sure that much of the code can be further optimized.
Anyway, if you have any idea/improvement , feel free to send a pull request!

### 🛠️ Dependencies:

- The [ACM Java Task Force library](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/) for the GUI objects of the application.
