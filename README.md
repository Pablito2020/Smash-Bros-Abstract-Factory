# Smash-Bros-Factory

This project tries to incorporate the factory design pattern (not to be confused with abstract factory) with smash bros characters.


For now, the project is quite simple and it doesn't includes any GUI (also, in java it's a pain to incorporate GUI components (at least for a noob like me without a proper library to work on))
