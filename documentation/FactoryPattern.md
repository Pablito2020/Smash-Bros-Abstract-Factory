  The factory design pattern
</h1>

### 🙌 Utilities of this pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
In this project, I used this pattern to specify the different levels of the game (easy and difficult) and create the Heros and Enemies depending on the level.

### ❓ Prerequesites to understand the abstract factory design pattern:

- Polymorphism

- Abstraction (interfaces and abstract classes)

- Enums (not really needed but it can be very handy to apply these with this pattern)

- Factory Design pattern.
