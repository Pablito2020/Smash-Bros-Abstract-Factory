  The factory design pattern
</h1>

### 🙌 Utilities of this pattern

This pattern is really usefull to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the
objecct that will be created. In this project, I used this pattern to specify the different levels of the game (easy and difficult)
and create certain objects depending of the level choosed.

### ❓ Prerequesites to understand the factory design pattern:

- Polymorphism

- Abstraction (interfaces and abstract classes)

- Enums (not really needed but it can be very handy to apply these with this pattern)
